# ml_jupyter_sandbox
Leverage Docker and Jupyter notebooks to better understand various regression and clustering models.

# How to Start
Navigate to the directory where docker-compose.yml exists. In a shell window type 
```
docker-compose up
```

This should start the container running jupyter lab. In the output from the shell it will indicate something with a url and token. Something like
http://localhost:8888?token=123abc. Paste that into chrome and get started.
